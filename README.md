Not really a game, just XNA/MG learning sandbox.  The goal here is to run into every (almost?) scenario that would come up when building an actual 2D MG game, and architect a framework of classes around them, so a "real" game(s) can be build afterwards.  Literally all XNA/MG tutorials are old and very limited...and (mostly) written by poor developers.  My hope here is to continue to build this and refactor it over time until it reaches a stable point where very little "unexpected" code changes would have to be made when building a real game.  This will be a VERY LONG work in progress.....and eventually maybe a tutorial/reference for others.
